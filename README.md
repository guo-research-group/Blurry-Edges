## 0 Introduction

Blurry-Edges is a new image patch representation, Blurry-Edges, that explicitly stores and visualizes a rich set of low-level patch information, including boundaries, color, and smoothness. We develop a deep neural network architecture that predicts the Blurry-Edges representation from a pair of differently defocused images, from which depth can be analytically calculated using a novel DfD relation we derive.

## 1 Usage

### 1.1 Configure environment

Create a conda environment, please follow the prompts below. 
```
git clone https://github.com/guo-research-group/Blurry-Edges.git
cd Blurry-Edges
conda create -n blurry_edges python=3.9
conda activate blurry_edges
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The training, validation, testing, and real captured data can be downloaded through <a href="https://blurry-edges.qiguo.org/data" title="Blurry-Edges dataset">this page</a>. In the meantime, users can also generate own training, validation, and testing sets by following the steps outlined below.

The pre-trained weights can be downloaded through <a href="https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/xu1639_purdue_edu/EqD_pFLP0d9MvTJVwXrq-8kBwrkd4IioWmzNKOiWR2DEwg" title="Blurry-Edges dataset">OneDrive</a>.

### 1.2 Training

Prepare the training and validation set containing only basic shapes.

    python train_val_data_generator.py

Train local stage.

    python local_training.py

Pre-calculate parameters to accelerate global stage training.

    python global_data_pre_cal.py

Train global stage.

    python global_training.py

### 1.3 Testing and evaluation

Test with synthetic data containing realistic textures.

    python blurry_edges_test.py

Test with synthetic data containing realistic textures and output dense depth maps by assigning depth values to wedges.

    python blurry_edges_test.py --densify 'w'

Test with synthetic data containing realistic textures and output dense depth maps by U-Net post-prosseccing.

    python blurry_edges_test.py --densify 'pp'

Test with large-size synthetic data using blocks.

    python blurry_edges_test_big.py

### 1.4 Regenerate testing set

Users can generate the testing set (both regular and large size) by following steps. First, download [The Painting dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/paintings/) to `./data/Painting` and [MS COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) (for our experiments, we only use `2017 Val` images and `instances_val2017` annotations) to `./data/MS_COCO_annotations`. To generate the testing set with regular image size, run the following command:

    python test_data_generator.py

To generate the set with large image size, set `BIG = True`. We recommend using an image size of $147 + 4x$, where $x = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. Users should also update `big_img_size` and `n_margin_patch` arguments accordingly.
